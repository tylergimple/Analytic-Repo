Otherwise, it can be absolutely a dead end and awful place. Management is a pointless overpaid oligarchy, controlled by europe, with no power to influence any real change. It is incredibly ironic they are located (currently) on ""innovation"" campus yet have literally no control over their destiny. Over 10 years, the employee review system slowly went from legitimate accountability for actions, to simply ""who is a favorite."" The same goes for promotions. It all depends on what manager your are friends with, and what group you are in. The worst group by far is the repairs organization, which unfortunately is also the most stable if you would like to stay employed. (I left voluntarily) In this group, you are considered a 3rd rate engineer despite more work output than any ""program"" group employee. Also, you will be required to give up your nights, weekends, holidays on a perpetual basis for ""the business."" Family time, personal time does not matter to management if you are in this group. The rest of the office will enjoy their weekends off, and their 1/2 day fridays, but nope, not if you're in repair! Often, those who have ""signature delegations"" who can sign off on structural repairs of aircraft, are pressured to sign off on repairs despite not being able to prove structural capability. Even if the repair is analyzed properly and shown ""bad,"" next thing you know it is approved by ""the German hand wave."" This essentially means, that since you can't show damage or a repair as structurally acceptable, you simply say ""by engineering judgment"" it is okay to fly! Wohoo! Want to know what management said in an actual meeting in front of structural engineers? ""It's not like planes are falling out of the sky."" This was literally during the 737 Max crisis where planes DID fall out of the sky. There are numerous times I should have ""blown the whistle"" on things but I feared I would be fired. Tell me one whistleblower that has ever actually remained anonymous and kept their job. I still debate doing it because of the constant managerial push to disregard safety and proper analysis in pursuit of speed and output. I am incredibly grateful to be free of this toxic job. To give examples, analysis data quite often was either *MISSING*, inaccessible, unreadable, full of analysis errors or completely useless. Rarely could any of us as engineers have real faith in the data we were using to ""analyze"" repairs. Not only that, but we would use data for YEARS, then be told that those reports were the WRONG ONES!!! Did we go back and check old repairs? NOPE! You will also be beaten over the head why you are so inefficient. Perpetual understaffing and inability of management to understand the repairs workflow operations has lead to complete employee burnout, and incredible inefficiency. There are truly some of the best engineers I've known that work in repairs. However nearly all want out, but are trapped in aircraft or near retirement. There are many other things I could put out there, but at least this should be enough to say you've been warned. Oh, and contractors? Don't think for a second they'll hold up their end of the bargain once you're onboarded into repairs. If you hire for a particular night or weekend shift, the reality is, they will put you wherever they want whenever they want. This is why even the contractors quit."

Ample of opportunities to switch between teams and they encourage collaboration among teams within department at least. Weightage given to additional activities that adds value to business or generation of more budget in the department.,"Lacks a bit on basic infrastructure like laptops and other enabling devices, however they are gradually working on it. The image one has in mind about working in Airbus might not be met until one gets to work in their Europe locations since thatÕs where the major things happen and where one gets to see the true output of the work that he/she does from India with all the test rigs, assembly lines and other RnD centres being out there."

When one is looking fore a secure job in an international interesting company, Airbus is the perfect choice.","Given the fact that the salary does not really depend on performance, a lot of employees are doing a job by the book and once there 7 hours are over, they go home. This is, of course, perfectly fine but it does sth with the company culture when people know they get their salary no matter how they perform. Of course their are people who are super motivated and highly engaged, but due to the size of the company as well as its slow processes and patriarchic environment, this kind of employees often gets demotivated when they realise that their extra effort doesn't help them advancing or improving things. What's more, the company culture is quite focused on how people present themselves and their work instead of on what they actually contribute."

Airbus to me really cares for their people and will do the right thing by them so long as it is in their gift. Extremely compliant organisation.,"Everything is so slow!!! Takes forever to get things done. Extremely bureaucratic although you may not think so. So many layers of management to get through before a decision is made. Everything is led by France and they will impose things on the UK that does not suit it but you have to make it work based on the ordained parameters. I do not believe that you have much chance to grow and develop outside the realms of the role you were employed to do. If you do get the opportunity itÕs more about who you know. Extremely complex matrix organisation that just made the role more difficult as you are trying to navigate how the business works as well as doing your job.

Benefits are crap considering the size of the business and itÕs reputation. Really basic apart from the flexible working. Flexible working is 5 star."

The know how is excellent and there is a lot of work to do. However, this is only true for entry and early career  level. Always good to have the Airbus brand in your CV.
The award winning Leadership Academy is really cool to be part of.","If you are advanced or senior in your career you will find a minefield of backdrops - here are a few to consider: the culture is very discriminating unless you are French in FRA or German in GER. Politics is core: the French networks (eg ""Poly"") rule and as a foreigner you have little chance to get invited to them - which literally puts a hard stop on your career & progress in your  work wherever you are. If you consider a job outside France or Germany be warned: despite the luring promises of HR - there is no career advancement for you abroad - period! Must principle: Knowledge & Expertise counts nothing! Networks and saving your boss's job is everything. Must not: Believe Airbus will accelerate your career - in fact it will slow it down, as Airbus is 10-20 years behind modern leadership, technologies, workplace environment, tools, IT, HR, etc.
For advanced career it is NOT an advantage to have Airbus in your CV any longer, as (well informed) recruiters know that you literally lost your cutting edge in the years you spent surviving in an old fashioned industrial dinosaur - take cutting edge engineering or marketing as an example."

Interesting technology and end product (even though it really isn't rocket science).
Flexitime and ability to work paid overtime.","Low salaries for engineering staff - even contractors are poorly paid.
Odd culture - an awkward mix of Franco-German-British (ie. Marconi-esque for those that remember) management styles and culture.
Frustrating place to work - Every aspect of this business is process driven, inefficient and seems to take forever. Yes, you've guessed it, the gullible management have let the consultants in to sell them a series of overpriced 'projects' delivered by 'expert consultants' with little knowledge about how the business actually works. 'Lean' is the latest buzzword - great when you're making cheap mass-produced widgets/cars (eg. Toyota) but is it really applicable to essentially a low-volume bespoke product? The very processes that management use to improve efficiency are the very processes that hamper efficiency when real people try to implement them. Extremely frustrating. I found myself spending 25% of my time on paper chases, trying to get various bits of paper signed by managers and QA staff that knew very little about what they are actually signing. Inevitably when project timescales slip, the engineers and technicians then get blamed for not doing the job quickly enough!
Lack of career opportunity - little real career development. Yes, they love to bestow inflated job titles such as 'Higher Senior Engineer' to make people feel good about their plight, but in reality this just means a marginal increase in salary and no paid overtime as you try to climb higher. In the end, I left to work for one of Astrium's customers - 60% instant increase in pay and now with real scope to develop my career."

Overall laid-back management, they trust you to do the job and don't ask too many questions.  However, they expect you to be productive.  
There are annual reviews, so you always know where you stand.
Being in the defense business, the company has a 9-80 schedule in which everyone has every other Friday off.
If you like travel, this could be the company for you as there can be lots of it.
The company has a worldwide presence and it is a feather in your hat to work at such a company.
From everything I hear, it is a better (less corporate) work environment than nearby competitor Boeing.","The defense business is cyclical, hence there tend to be a lot of layoffs, followed by hiring sprees.  Not much in the form of advancement or promotions, unless you have been in the business for 20 years or more.  Promotions are not really formal, and usually come as a result of someone retiring.  There also are raise freezes as a result.  By the time you figure out how the business works, they have gotten a lot out of you.

There is a lot of travel involved, depending on your position.  If you like travel, this could be a pro for you.  However, decisions to travel are often made the last minute, hence it is hard to have a stable personal life at home. 

The business is a small world, hence there can be a small business mentality to things.
Most projects involve upgrading legacy projects and are headed by people in the business for 30 years or more.  This impairs creativity.

The management tends to not be clear about things when they change.

A varied and unequal experience across all sites and countries makes it feel even less fair (see the variety in the reviews here). Advertised as a competitive working environment with technical training although this is non-existent for the first few years. The projects and the process (although this could be endemic to the industry) is so complex that I am not surprised by the non-profitable nature of the company and the inability to meet deadlines or budgets. If you would like a foot in the door and to develop just enough so that you can be poached by another company then go for it. Otherwise stick around for four or five years in order to get noticed and perhaps be given something interesting to work on. 

Starting on a team or in the company in general is fairly daunting with no real integration or ""team spirit"", it's actually a really demotivating working environment on the most part and it's very hard to feed this back to upper management. A lot of the day is spent chasing up expenses and problems regarding HR as they seem to be overworked however this doesn't make it easy when emails and phone calls go unanswered for weeks."
